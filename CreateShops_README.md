# How to use

## Chest Setup
To prepare a chest to be converted into a villager, you'll need to place the items in a specific format.

* The first row of the chest is BuyA
* The second row of the chest is BuyB (this is optional)
* The third row of the chest is Sell

Each column represents a different trade. 

In the following example the chest is setup to give the villager two trades.

* (1) Emerald + (1) Quartz gives (16) Bread
* (5) Emerald + (1) Enchanted Book gives (1) Enchanted Sword

## Custom Name & Custom Name Visible
There are two ways to assign a custom name. If you enter a name in the *Custom Name* text field, it will apply that name to all shops within the selection. If you enable the *Inherit Name from Chest* option, it will override the *Custom Name* with the name of the chest (use an anvil to name the chest).

Enabling *Custom Name Visible* will make the name visible to the player (this only works if the behavior file has Nameable enabled)

## Custom Component Groups
This allows you to add custom component groups to the villager that is created. The format should be CSV. For example:

```componentGroup1,componentGroup2,componentGroup3```

## Reward XP
This is the amount of XP given for each trade a player makes.

## Professions
Though the Professions menu has multiple options, it really has two modes: Detect wool or set a specific profession. 

If you select a specific profession, **ALL** chests within your selection will turn into a villager using the profession you specified.

If you select Detect Wool, only chests with one of the following wool types placed directly above it will be converted into its associated villager profession.

* White -> Farmer
* Orange -> Fisherman
* Magenta -> Shepherd
* Light Blue -> Fletcher 
* Yellow -> Librarian
* Lime -> Cartographer
* Pink -> Cleric
* Gray -> Armorer
* Light Gray -> Weapon Smith
* Cyan -> Tool Smith
* Purple -> Butcher
* Blue -> Leather Worker

## Use Profession for Variant Only
Enabling this option makes it so the filter **does not** add the villagers profession to the `definitions` NBT tag, and only marks the `variant` tag with the proper variant (mostly useful if using custom component groups)

## Disable Trades
This removes all trades from the shop. Basically just turns a chest into a non-tradeable villager.

Only use this option if you know what you are doing. If the villager has the trading component and you enable this option, it can cause Minecraft to crash under certain conditions

## Stop Trade Upgrade
This makes it so the villager's trade tier won't be upgraded and start adding trades from the respective villager's trade loot table. This sets the `TradeTier` to -2000000000, meaning a player would have to make 2 billion trades (most villagers 2 billion +1) before they pull from their loot tables. This means realistically, loot tables for the applicable villager or villager variant will not affect villagers created by this filter.

Alternatively, you could set the villager's (or villager variant's) loot table to an empty trade table within your behavior packs if you want more control.

## Max Health
This sets the health of a villager to 1024. If you want to make sure your villager can't be killed, setup a `damage\_sensor` in their behvaior pack to negate the type of damage you want to protect them from.

## Unlimited Trades
This makes your trades unlimited (effectively at least â€” it's about 2 billion trades).
